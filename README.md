makes itself a preferred shopping destination by offering outstanding value, inspiration,
innovation and an exceptional guest experience that no other retailer can deliver.

insightful information about 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The dataset

I created a schema diagram that shows how the data is organized. It explains how
different things (like orders, customers, products, and payments) are connected and what
details they have. This schema helps us see how everything in the data is related and helps
us understand it better.
